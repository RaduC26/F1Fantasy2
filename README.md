# F1Fantasy2
An updated version of the F1 Fantasy Calculator

# What is F1 Fantasy?
F1 Fantasy is a fantasy game based on Formula 1, where each player can create it's own team based on a budget. Each team must have 5 drivers and 1 constructor and you score points after each race based on the performance of your drivers in the real race. Prices of the drivers and constructors vary from week to week and from day to day based on their performance. 

# What's new
This updated version of the F1 Fantasy Calculator brings a GUI version where you can input your budget and it will print out the 3 best teams that you can build.

# How to install
Simply download/clone the files and run the application from "Main.exe".

# How to use
After the window opens just input the budget and press the "Generate" button to calculate the teams.

# Technology used
Python was used due to its ease of use alongside Tkinter, one of its libraries, which allows the creation of a GUI.
